   The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies          classified by 
   group according to their features.This classification report could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients.
   We use the following methods for the analysis:
